  description: |
    Snorkel is a system for programmatically building and managing training
    datasets to rapidly and flexibly fuel machine learning models.
    Users write programmatic operations to label, transform, and structure training
    datasets for machine learning, without needing to hand label any training data.
    Snorkel then uses modern, theoretically-grounded modeling techniques to clean and
    integrate the resulting training data.
